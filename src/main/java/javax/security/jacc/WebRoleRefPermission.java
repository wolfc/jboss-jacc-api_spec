/** Class for Servlet isUserInRole (String reference) permissions. A
 * WebRoleRefPermission is a named permission and has actions.
 * 
 * The name of an WebRoleRefPermission (also referred to as the target name)
 * identifies a Web resource by the servlet name (in the deployment descriptor
 * corresponding to the component from which the call to isUserInRole
 * (String reference) is being made.
 * 
 * The actions of an WebRoleRefPermission identifies the role reference to which
 * the permission applies. A WebRoleRefPermission is checked to determine if the
 * subject is a member of the role identified by the reference.
 * 
 * Implementations of this class MAY implement newPermissionCollection or
 * inherit its implementation from the super class.
