/** The methods of this interface are used by containers to
 create policy statements in a Policy provider.
 An object that implements the PolicyConfiguration interface provides the
 policy statement configuration interface for a corresponding policy context
 within the corresponding Policy provider.

 The life cycle of a policy context is defined by three states; "open",
 "inService", and "deleted". A policy context is in one of these three states.

 A policy context in the "open" state is in the process of being 
 configured, and may be operated on by any of the methods of the 
 PolicyConfiguration interface. A policy context in the "open" state
 must not be assimilated at <code>Policy.refresh</code> into the policy
 statements used by the Policy provider in performing its access decisions.
 In order for the policy statements of a policy context to be assimilated
 by the associated provider, the policy context must be in the
 "inService" state. A policy context in the "open" state is transitioned to
 the "inService" state by calling the commit method.

 A policy context in the "inService" state is available for assimilation
 into the policy statements being used to perform access decisions by the
 associated Policy provider. Providers assimilate policy contexts containing
 policy statements when the refresh method of the provider is called. When
 a provider's refresh method is called, it must assimilate only those policy
 contexts whose state is "inService" and it must ensure that the policy
 statements put into service for each policy context are only those defined
 in the context at the time of the call to refresh. A policy context in the
 "inService" state is not available for additional configuration and may be
 returned to the "open" state by calling the getPolicyConfiguration method
 of the PolicyConfigurationFactory.

 A policy context in the "deleted" state is neither available for
 configuration, nor is it available for assimilation into the Provider. A
 policy context whose state is "deleted" may be reclaimed for subsequent
 processing by calling the getPolicyConfiguration method of the associated 
 PolicyConfigurationFactory. A "deleted" policy context
 is transitioned to the "open" state when it it returned as a result of
 a call to getPolicyConfiguration.

 The following table captures the correspondence between the policy context
 life cycle and the methods of the PolicyConfiguration interface.
 The rightmost 3 columns of the table correspond to the 
 PolicyConfiguration state identified at the head of the column.
 The values in the cells of these columns indicate
 the next state resulting from a call to the method 
 identifed in the leftmost column of the corresponding row, or that
 calling the method is unsupported in the state 
 represented by the column (in which case the state will remain unchanged).

 For a provider implementation to be compatible with multi-threaded
 environments, it may be necessary to synchronize the refresh method of
 the provider with the methods of its PolicyConfiguration interface and
 with the getPolicyConfiguration and inService methods of its
 PolicyConfigurationFactory.
